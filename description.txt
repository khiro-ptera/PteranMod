This mod will have more stuff... soon. My first mod, going great so far.
It's just got like a lotta weapons, an armor set, an enemy, 2 bosses, and a town NPC right now lol. 
Lots of stuff inspired by the game Spiral Knights because I'm not feeling creative, and these designs are cool lookin. 

v.0.1.11
Added a couple of accessories, a pet, new Catalyst weapon (which took me forever to make), droprate and balance changes.

v.0.1.10
Added several new weapons. Antigua line is now available with Bark Modules. Some balance changes and reworks of weapons.

v.0.1.8 & v.0.1.9
New boss Roarmulus Twins. Not much to get from him yet but that's a WIP. Also a few new weapons. Hotfix buffed Roarmulus Twins' AI, since it was lacking and too easy to cheese.
